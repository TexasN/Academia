Chapter 6 Web Exercise Assignment

ASSIGNMENT:

Recently, net neutrality has been a topic of discussion. Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers should be required to treat all Internet traffic running over their wired and wireless networks the same—without favoring content from some sources and/or blocking or slowing (also known as throttling) content from others. The debate over net neutrality raises questions about how best to keep the Internet open and impartial while still offering Internet service providers sufficient incentive to expand their networks to serve more customers and to support new services. Do research to find out the current status of net neutrality in the United States.

ASSIGNMENT: Write a report summarizing your findings and upload for grading.
